# 0x08 C - Recursion

## Description

This sub-module of ALX Low Level Programming introduces the concept of Recursion. Which is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A recursive function is a function that calls itself. It answers the following questions:-
- What is recursion
- How to implement recursion
- In what situations you should implement recursion
- In what situations you shouldn’t implement recursion
## Requirements
### General

- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- You are not allowed to use any kind of loops
- You are not allowed to use static variables
