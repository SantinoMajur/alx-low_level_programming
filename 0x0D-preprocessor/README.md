# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
## Description
This submodule of ALX low level programming introduces C programming preprocessors, compilation process, macros, include guard, standard and common predifined macros. It answers the following questions:-
- What are macros and how to use them
- What are the most common predefined macros
- How to include guard your header files

## Requirements
### General
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
