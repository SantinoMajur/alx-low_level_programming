# 0x00. C - Hello, World

## Description

This module of ALX Low Level Programming introduces the basics of C programming language. It shed light on the following questions
- Why C programming is awesome
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type gcc main.c
- What is an entry point
- What is main
- How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
- How to compile using gcc
- What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
- What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
- How does the main function influence the return value of the program

## Requirements
### C Programming Language

- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use system
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
